class AllauthSignalListener:
    """
    Listens to and processes events via the Django Signals system.

    Django Signals is basically an event dispatcher. It consists of Signals (which are the events)
    and Receivers, which listen for and handle those events. Signals are triggered by Senders,
    which are essentially just any class at all, and Receivers can filter the Signals they listen
    for by choosing a Sender, if required.

    Signals themselves define a set of arguments that they will provide to Receivers when the
    Signal is sent. They are always keyword arguments, and Django recommends that all Receiver
    functions accept them as `**kwargs` (and will supposedly error if you don't do this),
    supposedly because Signals can change in the future and your receivers should still work.

    Signals do provide a list of their arguments when they're initially constructed, but this
    is purely for documentation purposes only and Django does not enforce it.

    The Django Signals docs are here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/signals/
